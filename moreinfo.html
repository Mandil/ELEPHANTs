<p>Tsavo National Park in Kenya is probably on every wildlife enthusiasts bucket list. Renowned for its stories of man-eating lions, and admired for its famous elephants covered in red dust and the Critically Endangered hirola, a trip to Tsavo imbues tranquility in the African wilderness with the prospect of observing big tuskers in their natural environment.</p>

<p>Spanning an area of 22,000kmÂ² making it slightly bigger than South Africas Kruger, Tsavo is Kenyas largest national park. And I had the good fortune to be guided in the park for nearly a week by Richard Moller, the Chief Executive Officer of The Tsavo Trust, and stay at Satao Camp in Tsavo East, which kindly subsidised some of the accommodation, meals and transfers.</p>
<p>
The parks nine big tuskers are among perhaps only 40 on the whole African continent today, as these so-called "hundred-pounders" have been all but wiped out as a combined result of poaching, trophy hunting and large scale exploitation of ivory for consumer goods. So it was a dream of mine to try to locate a few of these remaining iconic giants, and capture them on camera for monitoring purposes and posterity.</p>

<header  class="margin"><h3>KEEP THE LAST 20 ELEPHANT TUSKERS ALIVE WITH 24/7 GUARDED PROTECTION!</h3></header>

<p class="margin">The Tsavo Trust operates the Big Tusker Project in conjunction with KWS and focusses on aerial and ground surveillance and data capture, backed up by the KWS's rapid reaction teams that deal with poaching incidents.</p>

<p class="margin">
Tsavo Trust CEO Richard Moller would like to see one or two of the iconic Tsavo super tuskers enjoy a Presidential Security Decree, as was the case with the famous tusker called Ahmed of Marsabit National Park in Kenya in the early 1970s. If successfully repeated, this will be a momentous achievement in conservation leadership by an African president.</p>
